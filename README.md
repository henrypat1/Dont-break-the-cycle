## API and Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This __must__ be properly formatted. An example is below:

{
    "records": [
        {
            "id": "recJ9AW9Vej3zqlRo",
            "fields": {
                "maintenence": "check pressure before you ride",
                "tools": "bike pump",
                "parts": "tires",
                "hazards": "punctured or deflated",
                "gear": "helmet",
                "tips": "change every 1000 miles"
            },
            "createdTime": "2021-07-12T22:46:40.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "recY1w1VsLxzr7lsd",
            "fields": {
                "maintenence": "clean and oil",
                "tools": "chain lubricant",
                "parts": "chain",
                "hazards": "worn out or break",
                "gear": "gloves",
                "tips": "you dont want to hear scraping"
            },
            "createdTime": "2021-07-12T22:46:40.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "recFeUoNAWYFYZfLF",
            "fields": {},
            "createdTime": "2021-07-12T22:46:40.000Z"
        }
    ],
    "offset": "recFeUoNAWYFYZfLF"
}




### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- Create api 
- Create hompage
- create navbar
- create Maintenance page
- create Safety page
- create Gear page
- Render data on page 
- create clickable data
- allow users to add tips

#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- Add second API
- Use local storage to save user favorites

### Weaknesses: Takes me a while to get started

### Opportunities: give me an opportunity to really create and work with the API

### Threats: Procrastination and fealling overwhelmed.
